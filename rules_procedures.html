/* ~~ The header is not given a width. It will extend the full width of your layout. It contains an image placeholder that should be replaced with your own linked logo. ~~ */
.header {
	background-color: #FFF;
}

/* ~~ These are the columns for the layout. ~~ 

1) Padding is only placed on the top and/or bottom of the divs. The elements within these divs have padding on their sides. This saves you from any "box model math". Keep in mind, if you add any side padding or border to the div itself, it will be added to the width you define to create the *total* width. You may also choose to remove the padding on the element in the div and place a second div within it with no width and the padding necessary for your design.

2) No margin has been given to the columns since they are all floated. If you must add margin, avoid placing it on the side you're floating toward (for example: a right margin on a div set to float right). Many times, padding can be used instead. For divs where this rule must be broken, you should add a "display:inline" declaration to the div's rule to tame a bug where some versions of Internet Explorer double the margin.

3) Since classes can be used multiple times in a document (and an element can also have multiple classes applied), the columns have been assigned class names instead of IDs. For example, two sidebar divs could be stacked if necessary. These can very easily be changed to IDs if that's your preference, as long as you'll only be using them once per document.

4) If you prefer your nav on the right instead of the left, simply float these columns the opposite direction (all right instead of all left) and they'll render in reverse order. There's no need to move the divs around in the HTML source.

          </p>
          <p align="left">The following is an abridged version of the <em>2016 CTST  Rules, Contest Procedures and Scoring Format</em>. For a complete version of the  Rules that includes the cover page and table of contents, click here: <strong><u><a href="CTST16_Rules.pdf" target="_blank">Print Friendly Version</a></u></strong>. All appendices to  the Rules may be found on the Forms page of this website. </p>
<p align="left">Dancers interested  in learning about CTST guidelines are encouraged to read sections V, VII, and X  (as a minimum). Event  Promoters, Prospective Event Promoters, and contest management personnel are  encouraged to read the entire document which follows.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>I.  General Information </strong></p>
<p>The Country  Two Step Tour (CTST) was formed in 2012 to promote the enjoyment and  advancement of social dancing in general, but specifically the Two Step. The CTST  seeks to achieve this objective by promoting and assisting in the development  of Two Step Jack and Jill dance contests.  </p>
<p>The CTST advises  the organizers and prospective organizers of dance events regarding the  advertising and administration of Two Step Jack and Jill dance contests. In  addition, the CTST sanctions dance events which choose to implement the  structure and procedures offered through the CTST format. Guidelines and  requirements for member events are included in Sections III and IV below.  </p>
<p>The CTST has  developed these Rules, Contest Procedures, and Scoring Format to assist promoters  and directors of Country, Swing and other related dance events, to plan and  produce Jack and Jill contests that are uniform in the significant aspects of  operation, and will promote a quality experience for their customers and  guests.  </p>
<p>For the dancers  that compete in sanctioned Jack and Jill Two Step contests, the CTST has  developed a points tracking system whereby competitors earn &ldquo;award points&rdquo; for  each contest in which the contestant finishes at or near the top of his or her  division. The number of award points earned is dependent upon the number of  competitors registered in a given division. A further explanation of the points  system and graduation provisions are included in the &ldquo;Competitor Information&rdquo;  section (Section V).     </p>
<p><strong>II.  New Event Application Guidelines and Requirements</strong></p>
<p>Prospective  member dance events may apply for sanctioning by the CTST by filling out an  event application form and paying an application fee. When received, the application  shall be reviewed by the CTST management committee and shall be approved or  rejected in a timely manner based in part upon compliance with the following  requirements:<br />
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>New Applicants shall fully complete the membership       application form detailing the proposed dates, location, event       owners/directors, divisions of competition to be offered and other       information relevant to the dance event as requested on the application       form. The required application form appears as Appendix A to this       document.    </li>
  <li>New Applicants shall pay a $50 application fee to       be submitted along with the completed application form. Collected fees       shall be applied to annual dues if the proposed event is approved. If       approved, the event will owe the balance of their $150 annual dues (an       additional $100). </li>
  <li>Event applicants shall refrain from proposing new       events within four (4) weeks <u>and</u> within 300 miles of another CTST       sanctioned dance event. Even if the distance exceeds 300 miles, the CTST       is unlikely to approve two (2) events for the same weekend when they are in       the same state/province (North America) or country (Europe). However, with       documented support and endorsement of the impacted, established event       director(s), the CTST may elect to make an exception to this general restriction.       The CTST may elect to modify the time and distance parameters of this       general restriction in the future should circumstances warrant.    </li>
  <li>Applicants shall agree that the decisions       regarding acceptance or denial of new membership requests shall be made at       the discretion of the CTST management committee. </li>
</ol>
<strong>III.  Guidelines and Requirements for All CTST Events</strong></p>
<p>All member  events must comply with the following requirements to maintain good standing  within the CTST:<br />
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Member events must be held in a hotel setting with       appropriate ballroom facilities and available sleeping rooms. However, new       applicants may propose and receive approval to host an event with a       &ldquo;substantially similar&rdquo; venue arrangement. For example, a convention       center, or a large dance studio or nightclub with       an adjacent or nearby hotel, would be considered &ldquo;substantially similar&rdquo;       to the traditional, single venue situation.  </li>
  <li>The duration of member events must be a minimum of       two (2) days and at least one of the days must be a Saturday or Sunday.</li>
  <li>Member events must offer at least two (2) of the       &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; divisions of competition (see Section VI for additional       discussion). </li>
  <li>Member events must follow all currently published       rules, contest format guidelines, registration procedures and scoring       procedures published by the CTST in this document and as contained in any       supplemental amendments and/or announcements. </li>
  <li>All member events shall collect a $1 participation       fee for every dance entry tracked by the CTST and submit these collected       fees to the CTST Administrator within ten (10) days of the event&rsquo;s conclusion.       Event directors are at liberty to include the $1 per entry fee within       their contest fee pricing structure, or to add the fee on top of the entry       fees. The Administrator&rsquo;s address is: P.O. Box 23326, Portland, OR 97281.    </li>
  <li>Member events shall conduct all aspects of the       event in a fair and ethical manner. Failure to comply with this ethical       standards provision, or any of the above guidelines and requirements, may cause       the CTST management committee to investigate reported violations and       consider appropriate disciplinary action which, if warranted, may include       revoking CTST sanctioning.   </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IV.  Guidelines and Requirements for Established CTST  Events</strong></p>
<p>Established  member events are those that have received sanctioning by the CTST and that  have held at least one (1) event in which a Two Step Jack and Jill contest was  conducted per this <em>Rules, Competition  Procedures and Scoring Format</em>. Established member events will annually  comply with the following requirements to maintain good standing within the CTST:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>All member events will pay annual dues on time and       in full. Annual dues shall be $150 per       sanctioned event, due and payable on or before September 1st.</li>
  <li>Any established event director may apply for an       additional CTST sanctioned event by completing a new event application       form and submitting it with the required application fee. If approved, the       application fee will be applied to the first year dues of the new event.       As described in Section II above, the CTST reserves the right to grant or       deny sanctioning to additional events at its discretion. Annual dues for       second (or third) events shall be half the amount of the initial event fee       and shall be due and payable at the same time. </li>
  <li>Any sanctioned event wishing to change its       established date, location, owners, or other <u>significant</u> aspects of       the original application, must inform the CTST at least three (3) months       prior to the event and receive approval from the CTST management       committee. However, movement forward or backward one week from the       established date to accommodate venue and other scheduling situations       shall not require approval from the CTST unless such movement causes two       (2) events to fall on the same weekend in the same state/province (North       America) or country (Europe).      </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>V.  Competitor Information, Guidelines and  Requirements</strong></p>
<p>CTST sanctioned  Jack and Jill contests are open and available to anyone who wishes to  participate, regardless of skill level. However, the CTST requires that only  males may compete as leaders, and only females may compete as followers. Other  information relevant to competitors is as follows:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Each competitor will be issued a CTST member identification       number (tracking number) after he/she receives his/her first award point.       Once assigned, the tracking number will remain the same throughout the       competitor&rsquo;s association with the CTST. Each contestant shall be       responsible for remembering their assigned number (once assigned) and supplying       the number to the event coordinators each time he/she registers for a CTST       contest.   </li>
  <li>With the exception of lifts above the shoulder       level (which are not permitted) there are no restrictions regarding dance       movement. However, it is highly recommended that variations of the basic patterns       (&ldquo;quick-quick, slow, slow&rdquo;; &ldquo;quick-quick, slow, quick-quick, slow&rdquo;; and/or       &ldquo;quick-quick, quick-quick, slow, slow&rdquo;) do not become so frequent or extended       the dance becomes unrecognizable. </li>
  <li>Two Step is defined as a progressive partner dance       that moves primarily in a counter-clockwise direction, where performers       weave in an intertwining of partnership, or move for short periods of side       by side action that then returns to weaving movement. Couples may also execute       single-use &lsquo;west coast&rsquo; type whip actions that momentarily stall       progression and catapult the follower back around the leader and then       continue down the floor to return to the weaving of partners. These moves       shall constitute the core concepts of the dance.</li>
  <li>Beginning January 20, 2016, with the exception of       petitioning contestants (see section XII below), all new CTST       participants, and participants without at least one (1) recorded point in       a skill level division above Novice, must enter CTST contests in the Novice       division. These participants must then remain in the Novice division until       sufficient points for graduation have been earned. Refer to the chart on       the following page for a very general definition of the skill levels available. </li>
  <li>Once tracking points have been awarded to a       competitor, he or she shall be responsible for registering in the correct       division at each CTST event. A hard copy or electronic database of current       registry points shall be available at each event for reference if the       competitor is unsure of his or her status. A discussion of which divisions       are tracked appears on the following page.    </li>
  <li>CTST sanctioned event directors are permitted to       set contest fees and registration deadlines as they so choose. Competitors       shall be responsible for discovering for themselves the applicable cut-off       dates and times, and for paying applicable contest fees before the advertised       registration deadlines. </li>
  <li>CTST sanctioned event directors shall decide       whether or not to offer a competitors&rsquo; meeting prior to the start of       sanctioned competition. If offered, and if designated a &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo;       meeting, competitors shall be responsible for attending the meeting and       following the direction of the chief judge or contest coordinator to       maintain their eligibility.</li>
  <li>The following divisions (when offered) shall be       &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; by the CTST.  Competitors       must be at least sixteen (16) years of age to compete in tracked       divisions. Any and all points awarded shall be reported to the CTST by the       member events, and the points shall be recorded in the CTST points       registry.</li>

<p>Competitors  are encouraged to also read sections VII, VIII, X and XI of this document. </p>
<p><strong>VI.  Contest Structure and Procedures</strong></p>
<p>While it is  the prerogative of event directors to organize their events in any manner they  choose regarding staffing of contest officials, the specific contests offered, the  selection of contest music, etc., the following minimum requirements must be met  in the tracked divisions for events to remain in good standing:  </p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Member events must offer at least two (2) of the four       (4) &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; divisions of competition. Again, the tracked divisions are: Novice,       Intermediate, Advanced, and All Stars. </li>
  <li>Member events must utilize a &ldquo;Chief Judge&rdquo; or       &ldquo;Contest Coordinator&rdquo; whose job it shall be to ensure that all aspects of this       Rules, Contest Procedures and Scoring Format have been properly followed. </li>
  <li>The most current version of the CTST points       registry database shall be utilized to ensure all contestants participating       in the tracked divisions register in the correct divisions. The points       registry is available at <a href="index-2.html">www.CountryTwoStepTour.com</a>.       Sanctioned directors may obtain a hard copy of the report prior to their       events by contacting the CTST via email at: <a href="mailto:info@CountryTwoStepTour.com">info@CountryTwoStepTour.com</a>.   </li>
  <li>Leaders and followers shall be paired randomly       prior to competition. Any reasonable pairing method, such as rotating the       leaders or followers, that ensures a truly random result shall be       acceptable.</li>
  <li>Contestants must pre-register for competition, and       attend contestants&rsquo; meetings when required, to permit eligibility       verification of all participants. In the case of uneven numbers of leaders       and followers in preliminary competition rounds, contests <u>shall not</u> be &ldquo;made even&rdquo; by moving contestants from one division to another, by       accepting additional members from the audience, or by designating       &ldquo;stand-in&rdquo; dancers. Should some leaders or followers be required to dance more       than once to accommodate uneven participation, the dancers shall be determined       using any rationale that promotes random pairings.              </li>
  <li>Contests may utilize as many preliminary rounds as       may be determined to be necessary by the event director and chief judge/       contest coordinator.</li>
  <li>A minimum of five (5) judges shall be used for all       rounds of competition. In preliminary rounds, separate panels of judges       may be used for leaders and followers, as long as each panel numbers three       (3) or more.   </li>
  <li>The event director(s) shall work in conjunction       with the chief judge/contest coordinators to ensure that judging       assignments are made that avoid judging bias (whether real or perceived)       for or against any particular contestant or group of contestants due to       personal, business, or other relationships. Judges should be selected and       be given skill-level assignments based on &ldquo;Two Step&rdquo; experience and       expertise if at all possible. </li>
  <li>Judges shall judge the contests independent from       one another utilizing appropriate ballots provided by the scoring       coordinator or chief judge/contest coordinator. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>VII.  Scoring and Awarding of Points</strong><br />
  The event&rsquo;s  Chief Judge/Contest Coordinator shall oversee the execution of any and all CTST  contests per CTST procedures and ensure the following:<br />
</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>Judges shall at all times be expected to reward       the best examples of &ldquo;spontaneous, social&rdquo; Two Step dancing. </li>
  <li>Judges will use &ldquo;relative placement&rdquo; to mark their       ballots during competition. Contest results must be tabulated utilizing a       &ldquo;majority rules&rdquo; scoring system (often referred to as the &ldquo;skating&rdquo; system&rdquo;).       The scoring coordinator and/or scrutineer must be someone knowledgeable       and skilled in the use of relative placement scoring techniques and the       majority rules scoring system. </li>
  <li>Scores shall be tabulated from the judges&rsquo; ballots       as soon as possible following the conclusion of each round of competition.       Results shall then be delivered to the chief judge/contest coordinator for       review and approval. Only the results of finals rounds of competition       shall be announced to the public, and reported to the CTST. Finals results       reports must include the placements of all finals participants.</li>
  <li>Points shall be determined and awarded based upon       the total number of competitors entered in each division. Points will be       recorded/tracked separately by leaders and followers. Points shall only be       awarded in contests where the number of leaders <u>or</u> the number of followers       equals five (5) or more. The following chart reflects the number of points       that will be awarded. In summary, only finalists receive award points, but       the number of points earned is determined by the total number of leaders       registered (for leaders) and total number of followers registered (for       followers) prior to any elimination rounds.  </li>
</ol>
<p>For  example: In a tracked CTST contest, <u>16 followers</u> and 4 leaders  registered. After 4 preliminary heats of 4 couples per heat, 8 of the followers  and each of the 4 leaders advanced to the finals. Following the two (2) finals  heats of competition (4 couples per heat; leaders dancing both times), the 8  follower finalists receive award points from Level 2 (the 13 to 30 category) on  the following page (reference second row of the table) since there were <u>16  total followers</u> who registered and danced. The leaders receive no award  points because the minimum of 5 entries was not met.<br />

<p>Additional  Note: Any finals leader or follower that could gain points for more than one  placement in an uneven finals round of competition, shall only receive the  number of award points corresponding to the higher placement.</p>
<p><strong>VIII.  Award Ceremonies and On-site Results Postings </strong></p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>As stated above, it is the prerogative of event       directors to organize their events as they choose. While the CTST has no       requirements regarding the amounts of cash or other prizes to the winners       of CTST tracked divisions, or any other Jack and Jill contest divisions       offered, it is suggested that, in addition to the population of entrants       in each contest division, event directors also give consideration to the       skill level of the divisions when deciding what types of prizes to       distribute to the winners.    </li>
  <li>Further, the CTST has no requirements for how       awards ceremonies are to be conducted, or if they must be held at all.       However, it shall be a requirement that near or upon conclusion of the       event, the scoring coordinator/scrutineer (or his/her designee) shall post       in a conspicuous place the finals placements for each CTST tracked Jack       and Jill division. The posted results must include the final placement for       every competitor that participated in the finals round of competition. It       is suggested that in similar fashion, events post the finals results for       all two step Jack and Jill divisions, not just the tracked divisions. Posting       the judges&rsquo; names and actual scores shall be optional.  </li>
  <li>Event directors shall be free to announce as many       placements as they desire at their awards presentations (if held).       However, <em>posted</em> results on-site       and after the event on the event&rsquo;s web site (if utilized) must contain the       placement of <u>all finals participants</u>.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>IX.  Reporting Placements to the CTST</strong></p>
<p>Event  directors are required to submit their competition results, including the  number of competitors that registered in each division, to the CTST within  three (3) days or by the Wednesday immediately following the conclusion of  their event. The sooner results are submitted, the sooner the points may be  included in the points registry for use at future events. </p>
<p>Results may  be submitted in any manner deemed appropriate as long as the required  information is displayed logically. The &ldquo;Event Summary Report&rdquo;, appearing  herein as Appendix B, may be used to report overall event information. The &ldquo;Contest  Results Report&rdquo;, appearing herein as Appendix C, may be used to summarize each division  contested. Please submit results electronically to <a href="mailto:info@CountryTwoStepTour.com">info@CountryTwoStepTour.com</a>.  Results may also be submitted via regular mail to: CTST Results, c/o John  Daugherty, 3495 Cecelia Jo Rd., Ramona, CA 92065. </p>
<p>Only those  member events that are in good standing with the CTST shall have their points  added to the points registry database. </p>
<p><strong>X.  Graduation Provisions</strong></p>
<p>As  described earlier, successful competitors shall earn award points at various CTST  contests, and they shall be able to view their accumulated points in the points  registry. When a competitor earns the appropriate number of points in his/her  tracked division of sanctioned competition, he/she will &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to the next  highest level. Shown below are the entry and graduation provisions for each  tracked division.   </p>
<p><strong>Novice:</strong> Anyone who has never competed  before, or has not earned any CTST points above the Novice level, must enter  the Novice division (unless petitioning to a higher skill division – see Section  XII below). Novice level dancers <u>must</u> remain in the Novice Division  until they have earned at least 15 Novice level points.  </p>
<p><strong>Intermediate: </strong>Contestants that have been awarded  at least 15 Novice level points <u>must</u> graduate  from the Novice Division to the Intermediate Division. Intermediate level  dancers <u>must</u> remain in the Intermediate Division until they have earned  at least 30 Intermediate level points. </p>
<p><strong>Advanced:</strong> Contestants that have been awarded  at least 30 Intermediate level points <u>must</u> graduate from the  Intermediate Division to the Advanced Division. Advanced level dancers <u>must</u> remain in the Advanced Division until they have earned at least 45 Advanced level points.  </p>
<p><strong>All Stars:</strong> Contestants that have been awarded  at least 45 Advanced level points <u>must</u> graduate from the Advanced Division  to the All Stars Division. An All Star level dancer may compete in the All Stars  Division indefinitely. However, at events where an All Stars Division dancer  accepts an invitation to participate in the event&rsquo;s &ldquo;Invitational&rdquo; contest,  that dancer cannot also compete in that event&rsquo;s All Stars competition. Hence,  All Stars Division dancers shall not be permitted to compete in both of these  divisions at the same event.    </p>
<p><strong>XI.   Annual Points Championship Award</strong></p>
<p>Each year, the  CTST will present a year-end points championship award to the leader and  follower who accumulate the most award points in any of the &ldquo;tracked&rdquo; divisions  during the calendar year. This award will be an &ldquo;overall&rdquo; award, not one based  on any particular skill level. </p>
<p>The points  championship award shall be calculated using all CTST member events that  properly report their results as described in this rules document beginning  with the first scheduled CTST member event in January and ending with the last  scheduled CTST member event in December. Please consult the official CTST  website for the most current listing of member events. In addition to the  comprehensive points registry, the CTST website will also display current year award  points separately so interested parties may keep track of the current points  leaders. </p>
<p><strong>XII.  Special Provisions</strong></p>
<p>The CTST recognizes  that no set of rules and procedures can accommodate the needs and circumstances  of every competitor, of every contest, and of every event. The following  special provisions are included here to be used if circumstances warrant a  resolution outside of normal CTST guidelines:  </p>
<p><strong>Petitioning</strong> - If a competitor has compelling  reasons that he/she believes justify competing in a CTST tracked division above  or below the level for which he/she is currently eligible, he or she may  petition the event for a temporary reclassification. The competitor must  initiate a verbal petition request to either the event director(s) or chief  judge/contest coordinator no later than upon the conclusion of the contestants  meeting (if held), or two hours before the contest begins, whichever is  earlier. The event director(s) and the chief judge/contest coordinator shall  meet without the contestant present and make the decision based on the  circumstances of the petition. If the petition is granted, such approval shall  apply only to the current event, not to future events. If the contestant does  not earn any award points as a result of a granted temporary reclassification, the  competitor must re-petition at any future events if desired. However, should  the petition for a higher classification be granted, and the contestant earns  at least one point in a requested higher division, he/she shall remain  qualified (without further petitioning) to compete in the higher skill division  until he/she graduates out of the higher division.    </p>
<p><strong>Combining Divisions</strong> – Sometimes not all divisions of  Jack and Jill competition offered will generate sufficient entries to maintain  the integrity of a quality social competition experience. In the case of  significantly under-populated divisions, event directors shall be permitted to  combine contiguous skill-level divisions if desired. If the event director  elects to combine two or more skill level divisions, all points earned by the  competitors shall be awarded at the lowest skill level of the combined  divisions.  </p>
<p>Rather than  combining divisions, the CTST encourages event directors to instead cancel the  under populated division(s). The reasoning is that combining divisions generally  creates a disservice to both divisions: the participants rightfully positioned in  the lower of two combined divisions will generally be uncompetitive with participants  from the higher division, and those rightfully in the higher of the combined  divisions will not receive award points at their rightful skill level which will  move them closer toward graduation. If combining divisions becomes a frequent  practice, potential customers (especially Novice division) could stop  participating. </p></td>
